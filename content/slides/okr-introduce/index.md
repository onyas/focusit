# What is OKR

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR
* The objective is the clearly-defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were "measurable and verifiable".

???
Google often uses “Objectives and Key Results” (OKRs) to try to set ambitious goals and track progress.

---
# What is a good OKR

* Connect to organizational OKR
* Objective take you out of your comfort zone
* Key results are measurable,should value-based not activity-based

---
# Tips for set OKRs

* Three to five objectives with about three key results for each objective
* A mix of top-down and bottom-up suggestions
* Objectives should use tangible, objective, and unambiguous terms
* Transparency and open to clearly communicated teamwork
* Key results should describe outcomes, not activities

???
If the KRs include words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” “participate,” they’re describing activities. Instead, describe the impact of these activities, e.g., “publish customer service satisfaction levels by March 7th” rather than “assess customer service satisfaction.”
